# I Wanna QAQ #

## Summary ##

**IWannaQAQ is a 2D side-scrolling game that challenges both your reaction and your keyboard using ability. Our game was inspired by the game "I Wanna be the guy", a challenging side-scrolling game famous for it's unexpected traps
and sudden death. After playing "I Wanna be the guy", our team decide to build our own I wanna series. Thus, this game is born. As the suffix QAQ(a crying face) indicates, this game is not a game that you can pass when lying on a sofa. Our
goal is to provide you a challenge, and the sense of accomplishment. Be patient, and enjoy.**

**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer - Lin Zhu
**Email: lnpzhu@ucdavis.edu

For our game to run smoothly, it's crucial that our producers are both proactive and communicative to ensure all game components work together seamlessly, minimizing merge errors on GitHub. Additionally, the producer needs to manage the team members' workload effectively. I make it a priority to schedule tasks for everyone while maintaining flexibility, allowing our games to run more smoothly and be completed on time.

GitHub:

To prevent merge errors, I assign team members to work on their own scenes, and together, we merge all changes into the main scene. I take primary responsibility for handling pull requests, ensuring the code functions correctly, and managing merge errors. Furthermore, I've organized the project's assets into Unity folders, including scripts and audio, to improve organization.

Meeting:

To enhance efficiency and communication, I've set up a Discord server for our team, featuring multiple channels to outline links, roles, and goals. Over several weeks, we've conducted numerous meetings using this Discord server. To organize these meetings, I've created a meeting sheet to record the times and everyone's progress on tasks, available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMZtTGkEsrY30iUUHjTyAvzNhGUfZH5FAmNbdq0FOLI/edit?usp=sharing.

We ensure that tasks are clearly defined during development and maintain a Discord group chat for daily, prompt communication. This method is effective for us as few issues or decisions require everyone's collaboration. We've found that everyone is available on weekends, so we hold weekly meetings via Zoom then. Additionally, I organize more meetings as deadlines approach.

Other responsibilities include participating in enemy design and implementing the enemy's mobile attack and death. I also create character bullets and implement shooting functions.**
## User Interface and Input

**Our User Interface includes basic start screen, a place to load your saved data after entering and a replay interface when player dies. We made the UI characters 2D retro style so they can fit to the style of our game.**

**Since this is a 2D side-scrolling game, all we need is player to move and jump. We set up 2 sets of input settings(demonstrated above), also consider the difficulty of the game, we allow players to shoot the save points to save their progress
instead of touching them. We are so nice aren't we?**

**For now our project only supports keyboard and mouse input**

## Movement/Physics

**Describe the basics of movement and physics in your game. Is it the standard physics model? What did you change or modify? Did you make your movement scripts that do not use the physics system?**

## Animation and Visuals

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe how your work intersects with game feel, graphic design, and world-building. Include your visual style guide if one exists.**

## Game Logic

**Document the game states and game data you managed and the design patterns you used to complete your task.**

# Sub-Roles

## Audio

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe the implementation of your audio system.**

**Document the sound style.** 

## Gameplay Testing

**Add a link to the full results of your gameplay tests.**

**Summarize the key findings from your gameplay tests.**

## Narrative Design

**Document how the narrative is present in the game via assets, gameplay systems, and gameplay.** 

## Press Kit and Trailer

**Include links to your presskit materials and trailer.**

**Describe how you showcased your work. How did you choose what to show in the trailer? Why did you choose your screenshots?**

## Game Feel and Polish

**Document what you added to and how you tweaked your game to improve its game feel.**
